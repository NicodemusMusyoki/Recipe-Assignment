        <h1>Tenepade(Olive spread)</h1>
        <p>This is really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
        <p><q>Make this the night before so the flavours have time to blend. Just bring it up to the room temperature before<br/>you serve it, In the winter, try servingit warm. </q></p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>8oz. jar sundried tomatoes 2 large garlic cloces</li>
